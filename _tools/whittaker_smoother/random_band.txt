The main program is random_band.m



Description


The test signal has an instantaneous frequency which randomly
varies within the specified frequency range.  The instantaneous level 
is constant, the maximum amplitude is 1.   

The test signal is constructed by generating a a set of random number 
for the instantaneous frequency as a function of time.  
The instantaneous frequency is integrated to yield the phase angle. 
The trigonometric sin function is used to construct the real part of the 
amplitude.  

Filtering and normalizing is used to remove artifacts from the random 
number generation.  The resulting test signal is not a warble tone and 
it is not pink, white, or brown noise.  

The resulting test signal has characteristics of a warble tone.   
The level is more constant and the frequency is band limited
like a warble tone.  There is still some random variation in 
instantaneous frequency like white noise.  


[signal, inst_Frequency, inst_level]=random_band(Fs, N, fc, duration,num_channels, make_plot);  

The program returns a test signal (signal).  The user specifies the samping rate Fs, spectral 
width of 1/N octave band, center frequency
fc, duration in seconds, number of channels num_channels, and will make
three plots if make_plot=1;
